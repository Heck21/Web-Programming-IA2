      <h2>Trait and Hobby</h2>
      <p class="color">
        My strongest trait, resilience, has a profound impact on my academic
        life. When faced with challenging coursework, tight deadlines, or
        unexpected setbacks, I don't easily give in to discouragement. Instead,
        I approach each academic hurdle with a determination to overcome it,
        viewing obstacles as opportunities for growth. This mindset allows me to
        persevere through difficult subjects and demanding projects, ensuring
        that I continue to make progress in my academic journey.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, my hobby of learning about new things complements my
        academic pursuits perfectly. It fuels my curiosity, encourages a
        proactive approach to education, and enables me to explore diverse
        fields of knowledge beyond the classroom. This hobby not only enriches
        my academic experience but also fosters a lifelong love for learning,
        reinforcing my resilience and dedication to achieving my educational
        goals.

          <q>
            Success is not the key to happiness; happiness is the key to
            success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.

          - Albert Schweitzer

      <h2>Albert Schweitzer</h2>
      <p class="color">
        Albert Schweitzer was a highly respected theologian, philosopher,
        musician, and physician. He is best known for his humanitarian work in
        Africa, where he established a hospital in Gabon and dedicated his life
        to providing medical care to the less fortunate. I look up to him not
        only for his outstanding contributions to medicine and humanitarianism
        but also for his profound insights on life and the pursuit of purpose.

      <h2>Validity of Test</h2>
      <p class="color">
        I cannot speak about the general validity of the test but for my
        individual case I can safely say this test has no validity. I say this
        as many of the questions in the test I took didn't have answers that I
        felt represented me the best so having to pick from one of the two
        options might have resulted in not getting a proper assessment.
