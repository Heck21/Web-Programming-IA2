      <h2>Purpose of Pages</h2>
      <section id="purpose">
        <p id="land">
          The landing / index page is used to give a brief introduction to
          myself as well as acting like a central hub from which all other pages
          are connected.
        </p>
        <p id="prof">
          The professional page is used to highlight my resume as well as show
          my future career path along with the requirements needed for said job.
        </p>
        <p id="pers">
          The personality page serves as a small window into who I am as a
          person and what makes me, me. This is done through a personality test
          which is included on page as well as my strongest trait and favorite
          quote.
        </p>
        <p id="devl">
          The personal development page provided a good opportunity to improve
          my knowledge on [THING] by reading the given material. It also
          provides a chance to reflect on what I've learnt in roughly my first
          year in university.
        </p>
        <p id="stry">
          The storyboard page you're currently on provides an opportunity to
          take about the finer details of my website such as the colors chosen,
          features used etc.
        </p>
        <p id="refr">
          The reference page is used to give credit to all the amazing sites I
          used for reference while doing this assignment.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>Theme</h2>
      <p>
        The theme of my site is based around purple and some of it's shades and
        tones. I chose to do this as purple is my favorite color and I wanted to
        see how it would work with my website. The website has a light theme due
        to the use of the very light purple in the background. I utilized the
        darker shades to provide contrast and direct attention to specific
        content.
      </p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
        Two of the main features I used across my website were the "display:
        flex" and "display: grid" properties in CSS. This made it somewhat
        easier to create complicated layouts when I saw it necessary. <br />
        <br />
        Another feature that I used frequently was variables, this made it
        trivially easy to test different color schemes because I was able to
        have one value in a single place be used throughout the entire document.
        <br /><br />
        There are also images embedded throughout the site, both as actual
        content and as ways to redirect users else where.
